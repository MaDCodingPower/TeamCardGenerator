# TeamCardGenerator

## Description:

This is a program ran in the terminal that will take in responses from inquirer prompts and then write them into an HTML file. 
This entire program was designed to challenge me to use OOP to track data and use subclasses alongside testing with jest. 
The application will ask the user for information about a manager, and will then prompt the user to add an engineer, and intern,
or to finish off the team by ending the program and exiting out. The user can add as many members as they would like to, and a 
card will be generated with all inputed information onto the webpage/HTML file upon finishing with the application. 

## How to install and Run

To install the application, you must of course obtain all the files within the repository first. You can download the packages and
extract them to access. Open the folder containing all files with an IDE such as VS Code. You can also just use a terminal window
or something like GIT BASH. Download the dependencies required of the application, which really just includes inquirer. To do so, 
run the command 'npm i' in the terminal line. The latest update that came out 7 days before this README was written will crash the
application, so download the 8.4.2 version specifically.

## How to Start and Use

After installing the package, run the script through the command 'node ./index.js'. The application will then ask you a few questions. 
Simply answer the questions. When asked if you would like to add another member, choose one of either Intern or Engineer if you would
like to continue building your team roster. If you are done, just select 'finished'.
